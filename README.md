# Golang-Headset-Simulator

## Project Overview

This is an open source simulation framework for replicating neurotech headsets in Golang. this implementation uses a mixture of randomized and synthesized EEG patterns, enabling testing with fake datasets prior to usage of real time EEG data from real headsets.

## Key Details

All information about the design decisions is located in the design document. `main.go` holds the core logic of this application.
